This is my project for the Code Louisville Full Stack JavaScript class.  

The application is designed as a blog for the new Spaceman Brewery.

To start up the application:

1. Download the project from github
2. In the terminal run 'npm install' to install dependancy packages
3. Run 'mongod' to start the mongo daemon process
4. In a new terminal window run 'npm start' to start the application
5. In a browser window, go to 'localhost:3000'
